                <p>Over years of traveling and staying in Airbnbs around the world, certain features have stuck with us long after checkout. These aren't just amenities—they're the touches that transform a stay from good to unforgettable. Here are the features that inspired our own space in Winnipeg.</p>

                <h2>The Rooftop Garden in Barcelona</h2>
                <p>A small apartment in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter had a tiny rooftop terrace that the host had transformed into a lush garden. It wasn't fancy—just herbs, succulents, and a few comfortable chairs. But it became our favorite spot to start and end each day.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Outdoor space, no matter how small, adds incredible value. It's about creating a moment of escape, even in the heart of a city.</p>

                <h2>The Vintage Record Collection in Tokyo</h2>
                <p>In Shibuya, we stayed in a minimalist apartment that featured a carefully curated vinyl collection and a record player. The host had left a note explaining their favorite albums. We spent evenings discovering new music and felt a connection to the space we wouldn't have otherwise.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Personal collections that guests can interact with create memorable experiences. They tell a story and invite guests to engage with the space.</p>

                <h2>The Neighborhood History Wall in Lisbon</h2>
                <p>A restored apartment in Alfama had a wall dedicated to the neighborhood's history—old photos, maps, and stories about the area. It wasn't just decoration; it helped us understand and appreciate where we were staying.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Connecting guests to the location's story deepens their experience. That's why our guidebook includes neighborhood history and local context.</p>

                <h2>The Fully Stocked Pantry in Melbourne</h2>
                <p>In Melbourne, our host had stocked the pantry with local products—coffee from a nearby roaster, honey from a local beekeeper, and snacks from neighborhood shops. It wasn't just convenient; it introduced us to the local food scene.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Thoughtful local touches are more meaningful than generic amenities. They help guests experience the destination authentically.</p>

                <h2>The Reading Nook in Copenhagen</h2>
                <p>A small studio in Copenhagen had a window seat transformed into a reading nook with cushions, good lighting, and a selection of books about Danish design and culture. It became our favorite spot to relax.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Creating dedicated spaces for specific activities—reading, working, relaxing—makes a home feel more intentional and comfortable.</p>

                <h2>The Local Art Collection in Mexico City</h2>
                <p>In Roma Norte, our apartment featured artwork from local artists, each piece labeled with the artist's name and where to find their work. It turned the space into a gallery and gave us a reason to explore the neighborhood's art scene.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Supporting and showcasing local artists adds character while helping guests discover the local creative community.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The most memorable features aren't necessarily expensive or elaborate. They're thoughtful touches that create connection—to the space, to the location, or to the host's personality.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Features We've Incorporated</h2>
                <p>Inspired by these experiences, we've incorporated similar touches in our Winnipeg home:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Curated vintage finds</strong> that tell a story and add character</li>
                    <li><strong>Local art and crafts</strong> that celebrate Winnipeg's creative community</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive guidebooks</strong> that share neighborhood history and local insights</li>
                    <li><strong>Thoughtful reading materials</strong> about Winnipeg and mid-century design</li>
                    <li><strong>Dedicated workspaces</strong> for guests who need to work during their stay</li>
                    <li><strong>Local recommendations</strong> that go beyond tourist spots</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These features don't just make our space unique—they help guests connect with Winnipeg, with our neighborhood, and with the experience of staying in a thoughtfully designed home. That's what makes a stay memorable long after checkout.</p>
