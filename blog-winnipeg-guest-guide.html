            <div class="article-body">
                <p>After 14 years of hosting guests in Winnipeg, we've learned that the key to a successful stay isn't just about having a beautiful space—it's about setting clear expectations, providing helpful information, and helping guests feel comfortable throughout their visit. In this post, we'll share how we've structured our guest guide and house rules to help visitors have the best possible experience in Winnipeg.</p>

                <h2>Welcome to Winnipeg: Starting on the Right Foot</h2>
                <p>Every guest who stays with us receives a warm welcome message that begins with "Welcome to Winnipeg! I'm so glad to host you!" This simple greeting sets a positive tone and immediately makes guests feel valued. But beyond the warm welcome, we've found that providing comprehensive information upfront prevents misunderstandings and helps guests navigate their Winnipeg stay with confidence.</p>

                <p>Our guest guide covers everything from practical details like check-in procedures to Winnipeg-specific considerations like winter parking regulations and energy conservation. We believe that well-informed guests are happy guests, and happy guests make for successful stays.</p>

                <h2>Winnipeg-Specific Considerations: Weather and Utilities</h2>
                <p>Winnipeg has unique challenges that guests from other cities might not anticipate. One of the most important is our extreme winters, which require special attention to heating systems and parking regulations.</p>

                <h3>Thermostat and Energy Conservation</h3>
                <p>Winnipeg utilities are expensive, especially during our long, cold winters. We ask guests to help conserve energy by lowering the heat or turning off air conditioning when they're not home. However, we also provide clear winter instructions because frozen pipes are a real concern in Winnipeg's sub-zero temperatures.</p>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <p><strong>Important Winter Note:</strong> In winter months, to prevent damage like frozen pipes, guests must not turn off the thermostat or adjust the programmed temperature settings. This is crucial for protecting the property and ensuring guests stay warm and comfortable.</p>
                </div>

                <p>We provide clear instructions posted next to the thermostat, plus a helpful video tutorial (https://youtu.be/cD4ZVG3C7As) that shows guests exactly how to use the system. For extra comfort during Winnipeg's coldest months, we also provide additional heaters in the closet bedroom, with clear instructions to never leave them unattended and to return them when checking out.</p>

                <h3>Winnipeg Winter Parking: Know Your Zone</h3>
                <p>Winnipeg's winter parking regulations are something many visitors don't know about, but they're essential for avoiding tickets and towing. We provide detailed information about the "Know Your Zone" app and direct guests to the City of Winnipeg's snow route website (https://legacy.winnipeg.ca/PublicWorks/snow/default.stm).</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Winnipeg Winter Parking Tips:</strong> During winter, guests must check the Know Your Zone app or visit the City of Winnipeg snow route website regularly. Parking in snow routes can result in tickets or towing. We remind guests that any parking violations, towing, or vehicle damage are subject to Airbnb's policies and local regulations. We also note that car block heaters are not permitted, which is important information for visitors from warmer climates.</p>
                </div>

                <p>We also remind guests that while the neighborhood is generally quiet, like anywhere in Winnipeg, it's best not to leave valuables in cars. This practical advice helps protect both guests and their belongings.</p>

                <h3>Snow Shoveling in Winnipeg</h3>
                <p>From October through March, we aim to provide snow shoveling service within 48 hours after snowfall of 2 cm or more, when possible. However, we're transparent that weather conditions, contractor availability, and other factors may affect this timeline. If temperatures are expected to rise quickly and melt the snow, contractors may not shovel. We make it clear that guests are responsible for ensuring they can access the driveway and their vehicle, which may require shoveling around their car and walkway.</p>

                <p>This transparency prevents frustration and sets realistic expectations about Winnipeg's winter conditions.</p>

                <h2>Spring and Fall: Winnipeg's Shoulder Seasons</h2>
                <p>Winnipeg's spring and fall bring unique challenges that many visitors don't expect. Melting snow creates wet conditions and icy patches, especially in the mornings and evenings. We prepare guests for this by:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Warning about slippery sidewalks, driveways, and streets</li>
                    <li>Requesting that guests remove shoes at the door</li>
                    <li>Providing doormats to help keep the house clean</li>
                    <li>Explaining that weather can change quickly in Winnipeg</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This proactive communication helps prevent accidents and keeps the property clean during these transitional seasons.</p>

                <h2>House Rules: Clear Expectations for a Respectful Stay</h2>
                <p>We've found that clear house rules prevent misunderstandings and ensure everyone has a positive experience. Our rules are designed to protect the property, respect neighbors, and maintain a peaceful environment in our Winnipeg neighborhood.</p>

                <h3>Check-In and Check-Out</h3>
                <p>We provide clear check-in (after 4:00 p.m.) and checkout (before 10:00 a.m.) times, with self check-in via keypad for convenience. This gives guests flexibility while ensuring we have adequate time to prepare the space between stays.</p>

                <h3>Guest Limits and Quiet Hours</h3>
                <p>We limit stays to 6 guests maximum, with quiet hours from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. This respects our neighbors in this residential Winnipeg neighborhood and ensures everyone can enjoy their stay peacefully.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Why These Rules Matter:</strong> Our Winnipeg neighborhood is primarily residential, and we want to be good neighbors. Quiet hours and guest limits help maintain the peaceful atmosphere that makes our area special while ensuring all guests can relax and enjoy their stay.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Smoking Policy</h3>
                <p>Smoking is only permitted outdoors on the patio, with specific instructions to close the front door when smoking so smoke doesn't enter the house. We provide an ashtray and ask guests to dispose of ashes and cigarettes properly. This policy balances guest needs with property protection and neighbor consideration.</p>

                <h3>Restricted Areas</h3>
                <p>We clearly state that access to the backyard, hot tub, garage, and basement is not allowed. This protects both guests and property while setting clear boundaries.</p>

                <h2>Safety First: Informing Guests in Winnipeg</h2>
                <p>We prioritize guest safety by being transparent about safety considerations and devices to help guests make informed decisions about their stay.</p>

                <h3>Child Safety</h3>
                <p>We clearly state that our home is not suitable for children and infants, explaining that it hasn't been childproofed and includes features that may pose safety risks. We're specific about these risks:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sharp corners and breakable décor</li>
                    <li>Cleaning supplies stored in standard locations</li>
                    <li>Elevated television and furniture not secured for climbing</li>
                    <li>Window curtain strings</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This transparency helps families make informed decisions about whether our space is right for them.</p>

                <h3>Security and Safety Devices</h3>
                <p>We're upfront about security cameras on the exterior of the home and in non-accessible areas, plus a doorbell camera. We also clearly state that carbon monoxide and smoke alarms are installed. This transparency builds trust and ensures guests understand what safety measures are in place.</p>

                <h2>Practical Details: Making the Stay Smooth</h2>
                <p>Beyond rules and safety, we provide practical information that makes guests' stays easier and more comfortable.</p>

                <h3>Trash and Recycling in Winnipeg</h3>
                <p>We explain that trash and recycling bins are located in the alley beside the house, with pickup on Monday mornings. We provide extra garbage bags in the kitchen hallway closet or under the kitchen sink, so guests never have to wonder where to find supplies.</p>

                <h3>Remotes and Checkout</h3>
                <p>We provide clear instructions for returning remotes to specific locations (TV, soundbar, and living room light remotes to the basket on the coffee table; ceiling fan remotes to wall mounts). We also note that missing remotes may be subject to replacement charges through Airbnb's damage policy, which encourages careful handling.</p>

                <h3>Winnipeg Plumbing: A Special Note</h3>
                <p>Winnipeg's plumbing system is older and can only handle toilet paper and human waste. We're very clear about this, asking guests not to flush anything else—like wipes or sanitary products. We provide trash bins instead and note that bidets are installed to minimize waste and protect the environment.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Winnipeg Plumbing Tip:</strong> We ask guests to use toilet paper sparingly and explain that this helps care for both the plumbing system and the planet. This educational approach helps guests understand why this rule exists and encourages compliance.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Extra Services</h3>
                <p>We offer additional housekeeping during stays (including fresh linens) for an extra fee, and we're clear that the standard cleaning fee covers standard cleaning after checkout. We also provide extra towels and throw blankets in the hallway closet, with instructions to place used extra linens in the bathtub upon checkout.</p>

                <h2>Communication Throughout the Stay: A Proactive Approach</h2>
                <p>Perhaps the most important element of our guest guide is our emphasis on communication—not just encouraging guests to reach out, but proactively reaching out to them at key moments throughout their stay. We've found that timely, helpful messages at strategic points create a much better experience than waiting for guests to contact us.</p>

                <h3>Booking Confirmation: Setting the Tone</h3>
                <p>As soon as a booking is confirmed, we send a warm welcome message that does several important things:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Personal connection:</strong> We express genuine excitement about hosting them</li>
                    <li><strong>Guest count confirmation:</strong> We confirm the number of guests/visitors to ensure everyone is accounted for</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource links:</strong> We provide links to Winnipeg events, festivals, and attraction passes from Tourism Winnipeg</li>
                    <li><strong>Check-in timing:</strong> We clearly state check-in time (4:00 p.m.) and explain that early check-in isn't possible</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal story:</strong> We share that this is our home when we're not hosting, and that as a student, their booking helps fund our studies</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This personal touch helps guests understand that they're staying in someone's actual home, not just a generic rental property. It creates empathy and encourages respectful behavior.</p>

                <h3>Pre-Arrival Reminder: One Day Before</h3>
                <p>The day before check-in, we send a friendly reminder that includes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check-in time confirmation:</strong> Reminding them that check-in is anytime after 4:00 PM</li>
                    <li><strong>Winnipeg-specific tips:</strong> We proactively share information about the Know Your Zone app and Winnipeg's seasonal street-parking rules</li>
                    <li><strong>Helpful resources:</strong> Direct links to the City of Winnipeg's parking website</li>
                    <li><strong>Open invitation:</strong> Encouraging them to reach out with any questions before arrival</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Many visitors to Winnipeg don't know about our seasonal parking restrictions. By sharing this information proactively, we help guests avoid tickets and towing, which creates a much better first impression of their Winnipeg experience.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Check-In Day: Comprehensive Instructions</h3>
                <p>On the day of check-in, we send a detailed message with all the information guests need for a smooth arrival:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Checkout time reminder:</strong> We mention checkout time upfront so it's on their radar</li>
                    <li><strong>Smoking policy:</strong> Clear instructions about patio-only smoking and keeping doors closed</li>
                    <li><strong>Local recommendations:</strong> Links to our guidebook with favorite restaurants, cafes, and bars in the area</li>
                    <li><strong>Important warnings:</strong> Reminders about keeping doors fully closed to prevent damage</li>
                    <li><strong>Entry instructions:</strong> Step-by-step keypad instructions (the unique door code is provided separately through the Airbnb app for security)</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> If there are any issues (like a damaged closet door being replaced), we mention them upfront</li>
                    <li><strong>System instructions:</strong> Hot water tips, seasonal safety reminders</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We also include a photo of the keypad to make entry as easy as possible. This comprehensive message ensures guests have everything they need without having to search through multiple documents.</p>

                <h3>Mid-Stay Check-In: Ensuring Comfort</h3>
                <p>The morning after check-in (around 8:00 a.m.), we send a brief check-in message to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Confirm everything went smoothly:</strong> Asking if check-in went well</li>
                    <li><strong>Offer support:</strong> Encouraging them to reach out with any questions or needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Share local knowledge:</strong> Sometimes we include links to relevant blog posts about the neighborhood</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This message is intentionally brief and friendly—we don't want to be intrusive, but we want guests to know we're available and care about their experience. It's also an opportunity to catch any issues early.</p>

                <h3>Checkout Reminder: Making Departure Smooth</h3>
                <p>The evening before checkout, we send a thoughtful checkout reminder that includes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Appreciation:</strong> Thanking them for being great guests</li>
                    <li><strong>Specific reminders:</strong> Like returning electric heaters to the closet if used</li>
                    <li><strong>Checkout time:</strong> Clear reminder of the 10:00 a.m. checkout time</li>
                    <li><strong>Late checkout policy:</strong> Explaining that late checkout isn't available, with thanks for understanding</li>
                    <li><strong>Issue reporting:</strong> Encouraging them to report any issues, accidents, or details we should know about</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal gratitude:</strong> Sharing again how their booking helps as a student and host</li>
                    <li><strong>Future invitation:</strong> Inviting them to stay again if they return to Winnipeg</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We also include a clear checklist of what to do before leaving, making checkout straightforward and stress-free.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>The Communication Philosophy:</strong> We believe in proactive, helpful communication at every stage. Rather than waiting for problems to arise, we reach out with useful information, friendly check-ins, and clear instructions. This approach prevents issues, builds trust, and creates a more personal connection with guests. It's the difference between being a host and being a helpful friend who happens to be hosting.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Open Door Policy: Encouraging Guest Communication</h3>
                <p>Throughout all our messages, we maintain an open, non-judgmental tone. We tell guests: "Accidents happen! If something breaks or isn't working, please let me know as soon as possible through the Airbnb app. The sooner I hear from you, the easier it is to help."</p>

                <p>This approach encourages guests to report issues immediately, which allows us to address problems quickly and prevents small issues from becoming big ones. It also creates a relationship where guests feel comfortable reaching out, knowing they won't be judged or penalized for honest mistakes.</p>

                <h2>Checkout: Making Departure Easy</h2>
                <p>We make checkout simple with clear instructions:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Gather used towels</li>
                    <li>Throw trash away</li>
                    <li>Lock up</li>
                    <li>Gather remotes in the basket in the living room</li>
                    <li>Empty the ashtray in the bins in the alley</li>
                    <li>Clean any dirty dishes, empty dishwasher</li>
                    <li>No need to strip or make the beds</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This clear, concise list makes checkout straightforward and helps ensure the property is ready for the next guests.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned: What Works in Winnipeg</h2>
                <p>After years of hosting in Winnipeg, we've learned several key lessons:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Be specific about Winnipeg conditions:</strong> Visitors from other cities don't always understand our extreme winters or unique regulations. Clear, detailed information prevents problems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Explain the "why":</strong> When guests understand why rules exist (like energy conservation or plumbing limitations), they're more likely to comply.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be transparent about safety:</strong> Clear safety information helps guests make informed decisions and protects everyone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make communication easy:</strong> Encouraging guests to report issues immediately helps us solve problems quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be proactive, not reactive:</strong> Reaching out at key moments (booking confirmation, pre-arrival, check-in day, mid-stay, checkout) prevents issues and creates a better experience than waiting for guests to contact us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set realistic expectations:</strong> Being honest about things like snow shoveling timelines or weather conditions prevents frustration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal connection matters:</strong> Sharing that this is our home and that bookings help fund our studies creates empathy and encourages respectful behavior.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Creating a Positive Winnipeg Experience</h2>
                <p>Our goal is to ensure every guest has a wonderful experience in Winnipeg. By providing comprehensive information, clear rules, and helpful guidance, we help guests navigate their stay confidently. Whether it's understanding winter parking regulations, knowing how to use the thermostat, or simply knowing where to find extra towels, we want guests to feel supported throughout their visit.</p>

                <p>The feedback we receive tells us this approach works. Guests appreciate the detailed information, the clear communication, and the thoughtful consideration of Winnipeg-specific needs. They feel prepared, informed, and cared for—which is exactly what we want.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Final Thought:</strong> Hosting in Winnipeg comes with unique challenges, from extreme winters to older infrastructure. But by being transparent, providing detailed information, and maintaining clear communication, we can help guests have amazing experiences in our city. After all, a well-informed guest is a happy guest, and happy guests are what make hosting in Winnipeg so rewarding.</p>
                </div>

And if you're a fellow host, we hope these strategies help you create better experiences for your guests, whether you're hosting in Winnipeg or anywhere else in the world.</p>
