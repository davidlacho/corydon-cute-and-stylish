            <div class="article-body">
                <p>Welcome to Winnipeg, a city with a rich Indigenous heritage and the largest urban Indigenous population in Canada. As you explore our vibrant city, you'll have incredible opportunities to experience Indigenous culture, cuisine, and entrepreneurship firsthand.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Winnipeg's Indigenous Heritage</h2>

                <p>Winnipeg is located on <strong>Treaty 1 Territory</strong>, the traditional and ancestral lands of the Anishinaabe (Ojibway), Ininew (Cree), Oji-Cree, Dakota, and Dene peoples. The city also sits in the <strong>National Homeland of the Red River Métis Nation</strong>.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Treaty 1: The First Numbered Treaty</h3>
                    <p>Treaty 1 was signed on August 3, 1871, at Lower Fort Garry, making it the first of the Numbered Treaties. Seven First Nations are part of this historic treaty:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Peguis First Nation</li>
                        <li>Sagkeeng First Nation</li>
                        <li>Brokenhead Ojibway Nation</li>
                        <li>Roseau River Anishinaabe First Nation</li>
                        <li>Long Plain First Nation</li>
                        <li>Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation</li>
                        <li>Swan Lake First Nation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p><strong>The Forks</strong>, where the Red and Assiniboine rivers meet, has been a gathering place for Indigenous peoples for over 6,000 years—recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada. This sacred meeting place continues to serve as a cultural hub where visitors can learn about Indigenous history and traditions.</p>

                <h2>Traditional Indigenous Foods to Try</h2>

                <p>When you're in Winnipeg, make sure to sample these traditional Indigenous ingredients and dishes:</p>

                <h3>Bannock</h3>
                <p>This traditional quick bread is a cornerstone of Indigenous cuisine. You'll find it served in countless creative ways—from bannock pizza to bannock burgers, and everything in between. It's delicious warm, often served with butter, jam, or as a base for savory toppings.</p>

                <h3>Bison</h3>
                <p>Manitoba bison is a local specialty with deep Indigenous roots. Try bison ribs, bison burgers, bison chili, or slow-roasted bison. The meat is leaner than beef with a rich, slightly sweet flavor.</p>

                <h3>Pickerel (Walleye)</h3>
                <p>This freshwater fish is abundant in Manitoba's lakes and a staple in Indigenous cuisine. Look for dishes featuring Manitoba pickerel, often served with wild rice and seasonal vegetables, or try fried walleye cheeks for something unique.</p>

                <h3>Wild Rice (Manoomin)</h3>
                <p>Known as manoomin in Ojibway, wild rice is a sacred food that grows in Manitoba's lakes and rivers. It's often served in pilafs, soups, or as a side dish.</p>

                <h3>Saskatoon Berries</h3>
                <p>These purple berries are native to the prairies and have a sweet, nutty flavor. Try them in vinaigrettes, pies, or preserves.</p>

                <h3>Traditional Game</h3>
                <p>You may also encounter dishes featuring Arctic char, elk, or other traditional game meats prepared in both traditional and contemporary styles.</p>
