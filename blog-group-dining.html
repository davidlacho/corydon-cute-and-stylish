                    <p><strong>Planning Tip:</strong> When booking group dining, always call ahead to confirm capacity, private room availability, and any special requirements. Many restaurants require advance reservations for groups of 8 or more, and some offer special group menus or prix fixe options that can simplify planning and ensure smooth service.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Accessibility & Special Considerations</h2>

                <p>Many of Winnipeg's group-friendly restaurants offer wheelchair accessibility, though it's always best to confirm when making your reservation. Restaurants like Park Café at Assiniboine Park and venues at The Forks are designed with accessibility in mind.</p>

                <p>For groups with dietary restrictions or special requirements, most restaurants are happy to accommodate with advance notice. Whether you need vegetarian options, gluten-free alternatives, or specific cultural dietary requirements, Winnipeg's diverse restaurant scene can usually accommodate your needs.</p>

                <h2>Making Your Reservation</h2>

                <p>When planning group dining in Winnipeg, keep these tips in mind:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Book early:</strong> Private rooms and large party reservations often book weeks or months in advance, especially for popular dates and weekends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confirm details:</strong> Verify capacity, menu options, pricing, and any special requirements when making your reservation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider timing:</strong> Some restaurants offer better group rates or availability during off-peak hours or weekdays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask about catering:</strong> For very large groups, inquire about off-site catering options, which many restaurants offer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check parking:</strong> Confirm parking availability, especially for downtown locations, as this can be important for group events.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Location Advantage:</strong> Staying in Crescentwood puts you within easy reach of many of these group dining destinations. The Corydon neighbourhood is home to several excellent restaurants, and downtown venues are just a short drive or transit ride away. Our location makes it easy to host out-of-town guests and coordinate group dining experiences.</p>
                </div>
