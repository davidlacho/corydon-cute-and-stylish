            <div class="article-body">
                <p>The Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 remains one of the most significant events in Canadian labour and political history. For six weeks, tens of thousands of workers walked off the job in solidarity, and the strike’s violent climax—Bloody Saturday—left two dead and many injured. More than a century later, Winnipeg honours that moment with a powerful public artwork at the very corner where events unfolded. Whether you’re staying in the Corydon area or exploring downtown, understanding this history adds depth to a visit to the city.</p>

                <h2>Why the Strike Happened</h2>
                <p>After the First World War, many Canadians faced rising prices, stagnant wages, and poor working conditions. Returning soldiers often found few jobs and little support. In Winnipeg, building and metal trades workers had been trying to win collective bargaining and better pay. When employers refused to negotiate, the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council called for a general strike in support of the building and metal workers.</p>

                <p>On <strong>May 15, 1919</strong>, the strike began. Within days, roughly 30,000 workers—from factory hands to clerks, transit workers to cooks—had left their jobs. Factories, railways, and streetcars largely stopped. The city’s business establishment and many levels of government saw the strike as a threat and moved to break it: strike leaders were arrested, and special police and militia were brought in.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Scale of the strike:</strong> At its peak, the Winnipeg General Strike involved about 30,000 workers in a city of around 175,000 people—one of the largest general strikes in North American history.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Bloody Saturday: June 21, 1919</h2>
                <p>On the morning of Saturday, June 21, 1919, veterans and others gathered for a silent march to protest the arrest of strike leaders. The crowd moved along Main Street near Market Avenue. A streetcar operated by strikebreakers was driven into the crowd; protesters rocked it off the tracks and set it on fire. That incident was captured in one of Canada’s most famous labour photographs, by L.B. Foote.</p>

                <p>Mounted police and special constables charged the crowd. When it was over, two protesters were dead and many others were injured—including more than two dozen who needed hospital care. The image of the burning streetcar and the violence of that day came to define the strike in memory and in history books.</p>

                <p>The strike was called off soon after. In the years that followed, several strike leaders were convicted, but the event also fuelled support for labour rights and political change across Canada.</p>

                <h2>Remembering Bloody Saturday: The Public Art at Pantages Plaza</h2>
                <p>On the 100th anniversary of Bloody Saturday—<strong>June 21, 2019</strong>—Winnipeg unveiled a permanent public artwork dedicated to that day. The piece stands at <strong>Main Street and Market Avenue</strong>, on Pantages Theatre Plaza, the same intersection where the streetcar was tipped and set ablaze in 1919.</p>

                <p>Artists <strong>Bernie Miller and Noam Gonick</strong> created a sculpture that evokes the stricken streetcar: a skeletal form in weathering steel and stainless steel, with tempered glass, rising from the pavement like a ghost of the original trolley. At night it is lit from within, so the memory of the event stays visible to the thousands of people who pass through the area every day—near City Hall, the Centennial Concert Hall, the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre, and The Manitoba Museum.</p>

                <p>The work draws directly on L.B. Foote’s 1919 photograph and on the idea that Winnipeg’s identity—its grit, its solidarity, and its willingness to stand up for fairness—was shaped in part by that strike and by Bloody Saturday. The sculpture is meant to keep that history in the public eye for the next hundred years and to prompt questions about labour, justice, and why the strike still resonates today.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Where to see it:</strong> The Bloody Saturday artwork is on Pantages Theatre Plaza at Main Street and Market Avenue in downtown Winnipeg. It’s free to visit, visible day and night, and a short walk from City Hall, the Exchange District, and the rest of the entertainment district. If you’re staying in Corydon or Crescentwood, it’s a quick bus or drive downtown.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Why It Still Matters</h2>
                <p>The Winnipeg General Strike didn’t win its immediate demands, but it helped push Canada toward broader collective bargaining, union recognition, and social programmes. The strike and Bloody Saturday are still taught in schools and cited in discussions about workers’ rights, protest, and how cities remember difficult history.</p>

                <p>The 2019 memorial was commissioned by the <a href="https://www.winnipegarts.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Winnipeg Arts Council</a> through the city’s Public Art Program, with support from the Government of Canada, CentreVenture, The Winnipeg Foundation, labour unions, and many other partners. It stands as a reminder that public art can hold space for complex, sometimes painful stories—and that Winnipeg’s character was forged in part on that corner, on that Saturday, in 1919.</p>

                <h2>Visit the Memorial</h2>
                <p>If you’re in Winnipeg—whether for a Jets game, a show at the Concert Hall, or a walk through the Exchange District—take a few minutes to stop at Main and Market. The Bloody Saturday sculpture is one of the city’s most meaningful public artworks and a direct link to a turning point in Canadian history. For guests at our Corydon-area Airbnb, it’s an easy addition to a downtown day: combine it with a visit to <a href="https://staywinnipeg.ca/blog-exchange-district.html">the Exchange District</a>, <a href="https://staywinnipeg.ca/blog-the-forks.html">The Forks</a>, or <a href="https://staywinnipeg.ca/blog-human-rights-museum.html">the Canadian Museum for Human Rights</a> to see how Winnipeg remembers and reflects on its past.</p>
