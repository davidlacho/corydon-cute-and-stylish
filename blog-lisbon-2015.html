                <p>Sometimes, a single stay can change everything. In 2015, we booked an apartment in Lisbon that didn't just provide a place to sleep—it felt like home. That experience fundamentally shaped how we think about hosting, design, and what makes a space truly special. Even now, nearly a decade later, we draw inspiration from that stay.</p>

                <h2>The Moment We Knew It Was Special</h2>
                <p>From the moment we walked in, something felt different. This wasn't a sterile hotel room or a generic vacation rental. It was a space that someone had clearly put thought into—a place where you could imagine actually living. The furniture wasn't just functional; it was comfortable and inviting. The kitchen wasn't just equipped; it was a place where you'd want to cook. The living area wasn't just a space to pass through; it was somewhere you'd want to spend time.</p>
                <p>That feeling of being "homey" is hard to describe, but you know it when you feel it. It's the difference between staying somewhere and feeling like you belong somewhere.</p>

                <h2>What Made It Feel Like Home</h2>
                <p>Looking back, it wasn't any single feature that created that homey feeling. It was the combination of many thoughtful details:</p>
                
                <h3>Comfort Over Style</h3>
                <p>The furniture was comfortable first, stylish second. You could sink into the couch and actually relax. The bed felt like a real bed, not a hotel bed. The chairs were places you'd want to sit, not just look at.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Beautiful spaces are important, but comfort is what makes guests want to stay. In our Winnipeg home, we've chosen every piece of furniture with both aesthetics and comfort in mind. Our guests often comment on how comfortable the space is, and that's no accident—it's a direct lesson from that Lisbon apartment.</p>

                <h3>Thoughtful Details That Matter</h3>
                <p>It wasn't about expensive amenities or flashy features. It was about the small things: good lighting that created atmosphere, quality linens that made you feel pampered, a well-stocked kitchen that made cooking a pleasure rather than a chore. There were books on the shelves, art on the walls, and little touches that made it feel lived-in in the best way.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> The details that matter aren't always the expensive ones. They're the ones that show someone cared. In our space, we've added vintage finds, local artwork, and thoughtful touches that make it feel like a real home, not just a rental property.</p>

                <h3>A Space That Invited You to Stay</h3>
                <p>Many vacation rentals feel like places you're meant to leave—spaces designed for coming and going, not for lingering. This apartment was different. It invited you to stay. To have a slow morning with coffee. To cook a meal. To read a book. To simply be.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Great Airbnbs aren't just places to sleep—they're places to live, even if just for a few days. We've designed our Winnipeg home with this in mind, creating spaces that invite guests to slow down and enjoy their stay.</p>

                <h2>How It Shaped Our Hosting Philosophy</h2>
                <p>That 2015 stay didn't just inspire us—it fundamentally changed how we approach hosting. When we decided to create our own Airbnb in Winnipeg, we kept coming back to that apartment as our reference point.</p>

                <h3>Prioritizing the Feeling Over the Features</h3>
                <p>It's easy to get caught up in listing amenities and features. But that Lisbon apartment taught us that what guests remember isn't the list of amenities—it's how the space made them feel. Did they feel comfortable? Did they feel at home? Did they feel like they could relax?</p>
                <p>In our Winnipeg property, we focus on creating that same feeling. Yes, we have great amenities, but more importantly, we have a space that feels welcoming and comfortable from the moment guests walk in.</p>

                <h3>Designing for Real Life</h3>
                <p>That apartment wasn't designed for Instagram—it was designed for living. The layout made sense. The spaces flowed naturally. Everything had a purpose, and everything was accessible. It was a space that worked, not just looked good.</p>
                <p>We've applied this same philosophy to our Winnipeg home. Every design decision is made with our guests' actual experience in mind. How will they use this space? What will make their stay more comfortable? What will make them want to come back?</p>

                <h3>The Power of Authenticity</h3>
                <p>That apartment felt authentic. It wasn't trying to be something it wasn't. It was a real home that happened to be available for rent, and that authenticity was part of what made it special.</p>
                <p>In our Winnipeg property, we've embraced our mid-century modern aesthetic and our Corydon Village location. We're not trying to be a luxury hotel or a generic vacation rental. We're being ourselves, and that authenticity resonates with our guests.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>The Lasting Impact:</strong> Nearly ten years later, we still think about that Lisbon apartment. It wasn't the most luxurious place we've stayed, and it didn't have the most amenities. But it had something more valuable: it felt like home. That feeling is what we strive to create for every guest who stays in our Winnipeg property. It's a high bar, but it's the one that matters most.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Lessons We Still Apply Today</h2>
                <p>Every time we make a decision about our Winnipeg property—whether it's choosing a new piece of furniture, adding an amenity, or updating our guest communication—we ask ourselves: "Would this make the space feel more like home?"</p>
                <p>That 2015 stay taught us that the best Airbnbs aren't the ones with the most features or the fanciest finishes. They're the ones that make guests feel like they've found a home away from home. That's the standard we set for ourselves, and it's a standard we learned from a special apartment in Lisbon.</p>

                <h2>Why This Stay Still Matters</h2>
                <p>In the years since that 2015 stay, we've stayed in many Airbnbs around the world. Some have been more luxurious, some have had better views, and some have had more amenities. But few have captured that same feeling of being truly homey.</p>
                <p>That's why we still draw inspiration from it. Not because it was perfect, but because it understood something fundamental about what makes a space special: it's not about what you have—it's about how it makes people feel.</p>
                <p>As hosts, we're not just providing a place to stay. We're creating an experience. And that 2015 Lisbon apartment showed us that the best experiences are the ones that feel like coming home.</p>
