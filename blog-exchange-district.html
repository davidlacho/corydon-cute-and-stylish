                <p>Step into Winnipeg's Exchange District and you'll find yourself transported to the early 20th century, when Winnipeg was known as the "Chicago of the North." This 20-block National Historic Site is home to North America's largest collection of early 20th-century terracotta and cut-stone architecture. Today, these magnificent buildings house art galleries, restaurants, shops, and offices, creating a vibrant neighborhood that honors its past while embracing the future.</p>

                <h2>The Golden Age of Architecture</h2>
                <p>The Exchange District was built during Winnipeg's boom years, roughly between 1880 and 1920, when the city was one of the fastest-growing in North America. The district gets its name from the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, which was located here and played a crucial role in the city's development as a major grain trading center.</p>

                <p>During this period, Winnipeg's wealth and importance attracted some of the continent's best architects, who designed buildings in styles ranging from Chicago School to Beaux-Arts, Richardsonian Romanesque, and Art Deco. The result is a stunning collection of architecture that tells the story of a city at the height of its prosperity.</p>

                <h2>Architectural Highlights</h2>
                <p>Walking through the Exchange District is like visiting an open-air museum. Some notable buildings include:</p>

                <h3>Union Tower</h3>
                <p>One of the district's most recognizable landmarks, this 10-story building was completed in 1904 and features beautiful terracotta detailing and a distinctive clock tower.</p>

                <h3>Old Market Square</h3>
                <p>This public square is the heart of the Exchange District, hosting festivals, markets, and events throughout the year. The surrounding buildings showcase the district's architectural diversity.</p>

                <h3>Royal Albert Arms Hotel</h3>
                <p>This historic hotel building has been beautifully restored and now houses restaurants and offices, maintaining its original character while serving modern needs.</p>

                <h3>Grain Exchange Building</h3>
                <p>The building that gave the district its name, this structure represents the importance of grain trading to Winnipeg's economy and growth.</p>

                <h2>Art and Culture</h2>
                <p>Today, the Exchange District is Winnipeg's cultural hub, home to numerous art galleries, theaters, and creative spaces:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Art Galleries</strong> - The district is home to many of Winnipeg's best galleries, showcasing local and international artists</li>
                    <li><strong>The Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre</strong> - One of Canada's premier regional theaters</li>

                    <li><strong>Live Music Venues</strong> - From intimate clubs to larger concert halls</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Dining and Nightlife</h2>

                <h2>Walking Tours</h2>

                <h2>Preservation and Revitalization</h2>
                <p>The Exchange District's preservation is a testament to Winnipeg's commitment to honoring its history.

                <p>Today, the district is a model of successful urban preservation, showing how historic buildings can be adapted for modern use while maintaining their character and significance. The careful balance between preservation and development has created a neighborhood that's both historic and vibrant.</p>

                <h2>Why the Exchange District Matters</h2>
                <p>The Exchange District is more than just a collection of old buildings—it's a living testament to Winnipeg's history and a vibrant part of its present. It shows how a city can honor its past while building for the future, creating spaces that are both historically significant and dynamically alive.</p>
