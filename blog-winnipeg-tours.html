                <h3>Bois-des-Esprits</h3>
                <p>This 117-acre urban forest contains five different ecosystems—riverbottom, wetland, oak forest, aspen forest, and grassland—and is considered a vital part of the 27 km Seine River Greenway. Self-guided trails allow you to explore this natural oasis in the heart of the city, perfect for nature lovers and those seeking a peaceful escape.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Self-Guided Tour Tip:</strong> Many self-guided tours require smartphone apps or downloadable audio files. Be sure to download these before you start your tour, and consider bringing a portable charger for longer tours. GPS-guided tours work best with a fully charged phone and good data connection.</p>

                <h2>Seasonal Considerations</h2>

                <p>Many tours in Winnipeg operate seasonally, with peak season typically running from May through September. However, several tours are available year-round, and some operators offer special winter experiences. Here's what to know:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Summer (May-September):</strong> Most walking tours, boat tours, and outdoor experiences operate during these months. This is the busiest season, so book in advance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winter:</strong> Some tours adapt for winter conditions, and indoor tours (like the Royal Canadian Mint and Manitoba Legislative Building) operate year-round. The Trolley of Terror Ghost Tour offers a particularly atmospheric experience during winter months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Year-Round:</strong> Self-guided app tours, museum tours, and indoor experiences are available throughout the year, making them perfect options for winter visitors.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Planning Your Tour Experience</h2>

                <h3>Booking Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Book in advance:</strong> Popular tours, especially food tours and boat tours, often sell out quickly during peak season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check weather:</strong> Outdoor tours are weather-dependent. Have a backup plan for rainy days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Group sizes:</strong> Some tours have minimum or maximum group sizes. Check requirements when booking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Contact tour operators directly if you have mobility concerns or accessibility needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Combination tours:</strong> Consider combining a morning walking tour with an afternoon boat tour or museum visit to make the most of your day.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What to Bring</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Comfortable walking shoes (essential for walking tours)</li>
                    <li>Weather-appropriate clothing (Winnipeg weather can change quickly)</li>

                </ul>
