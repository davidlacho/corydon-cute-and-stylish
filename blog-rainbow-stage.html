                <p>When summer arrives in Winnipeg, there's something magical happening under the open sky at Kildonan Park. <a href="https://www.rainbowstage.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Rainbow Stage</a>, Canada's longest-running outdoor theatre company, has been entertaining audiences for over seven decades, and they're showing no signs of slowing down.</p>

                <h2>An Exciting 72nd Season Ahead</h2>

                <p>Following their most financially successful season in history, <a href="https://www.rainbowstage.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Rainbow Stage has announced an exciting lineup</a> for their 72nd season in 2026. The season will kick off in June with <a href="https://www.rainbowstage.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em></a>, marking the first time Andrew Lloyd Webber's iconic rock opera has graced the Kildonan Park stage. This groundbreaking musical tells the story of the final weeks of Jesus Christ's life through the eyes of Judas Iscariot, set to an unforgettable rock score.</p>

                <p>Next up is <em>Legally Blonde: The Musical</em> (August 13-30), the smash adaptation of the beloved 2001 comedy starring Reese Witherspoon. Follow Elle Woods as she defies stereotypical expectations, nails her LSATs, and proves that you can be both stylish and smart at Harvard Law School. What, like it's hard? Artistic director Carson Nattrass has wanted to stage this musical since starting the job in 2017, making it a particularly special production.</p>

                <p>The season concludes with a historic collaboration: Rainbow Stage is joining forces with Winnipeg Jewish Theatre to co-produce <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em> (September 9-13). This marks the first time a Rainbow Stage show will be produced under the dome in September, giving audiences the unique opportunity to experience Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's classic musical as it unfolds under a proper Prairie sunset.</p>

                <h2>A Seven-Decade Legacy</h2>

                <h3>From Flood to Rainbow: The Origin Story</h3>

                <p>Rainbow Stage's story begins with a disaster and ends with a dream realized. When the old bandstand in Kildonan Park was damaged in the devastating 1950 flood, Thomas R. Hodgson, superintendent of parks, and James Duncan, director of the University of Manitoba Glee Club, saw an opportunity. Inspired by Vancouver's Theatre Under the Stars, they envisioned replacing the damaged bandstand with an open-air theatre that would bring musical theatre to Winnipeg.</p>

                <p>After several attempts to pitch the idea, the Parks Board finally agreed to participate. The project architects, Smith-Carter-Katelnikoff, designed the distinctive structure we know today. But where did the name "Rainbow Stage" come from? Legend has it that when architect Dennis Carter arrived at a meeting with a cardboard model of the design, someone observed that if lights were strung along the top curvature of the structure, it would look like a rainbow. And so, the name was born.</p>

                <p>Construction began in 1951, funded by the Park Reserve Fund, the Junior Chamber of Commerce, and compensation from the Provincial Flood Fund. The first concert—a performance by the touring Kitsilano Boys Band from Vancouver—took place on September 22, 1953. Rainbow Stage officially opened with a variety benefit concert on July 7, 1954, featuring prominent local artists directed by James Duncan.</p>

                <h3>A Theatre That Shaped Canadian Talent</h3>

                <p>The theatre's first musical comedy, <em>Brigadoon</em>, was performed in September 1955, marking the beginning of a tradition. Since then, musical theatre has been the staple of the venue's summer seasons. Early participants included renowned Canadian director John Hirsch, choreographer Arnold Spohr, and actress Evelyn Anderson—artists who would go on to shape Canadian theatre history.</p>

                <p>Over the years, Rainbow Stage has staged everything from classic Broadway musicals to contemporary hits. <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em> alone has been performed at the venue four times (1971, 1977, 1984, and 1993), demonstrating the enduring appeal of these timeless stories. The 2,300-seat venue (approximately 2,200 seats available for sale) has welcomed nearly 50,000 attendees in peak seasons.</p>

                <h3>A Modern Renaissance</h3>

                <p>Under the leadership of Executive Producer Ken Peter, Rainbow Stage returned to its roots as a two-show, summer-only theatre in 2010. The company began investing in bringing set and prop construction back to the theatre, reviving the backstage carpentry shop after more than a decade. This commitment to quality production values opened doors to exciting collaborations, including Canadian Regional Theatre Premieres of Disney shows like <em>Mary Poppins</em> (2013) and <em>The Little Mermaid</em> (2014).</p>

                <p>In 2012, a new leadership structure promoted Julie Eccles to Executive Director and named Ray Hogg as the company's first-ever Artistic Director. Their shared vision focused on upholding the reputation earned over six decades while fostering growth and expansion. Since 2017, Artistic Director Carson Nattrass has continued this tradition, bringing fresh perspectives while honoring the theatre's storied past.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Both <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em> and <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em> became Oscar-winning films through the vision of late Canadian director Norman Jewison.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The People Behind the Magic</h2>

                <p>Artistic director Carson Nattrass has been carefully curating Rainbow Stage's programming since 2017. When selecting shows, he considers both audience requests and feedback from Winnipeg's performing community. The upcoming productions of <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em> and <em>Legally Blonde</em> were consistently among the top requested shows by both groups.</p>

                <p>For <em>Legally Blonde</em>, Nattrass is bringing back director Alexandra Herzog and choreographer Josh Assor for their third consecutive season as a tandem. The duo previously collaborated on <em>Mary Poppins</em> (2024) and <em>Rock of Ages</em> (2023), creating productions that delighted audiences. Renate Tabas (née Rossol) will serve as musical director.</p>

                <p><em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em> (June 25-July 12) will be directed by Sharon Bajer, who last directed at Rainbow Stage in 2019 when she helmed a revival of Danny Schur and Rick Chafe's <em>Strike! The Musical</em>.</p>

                <p>The historic <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em> collaboration will be directed by Winnipeg Jewish Theatre's artistic director Dan Petrenko. The production will feature a full, onstage orchestra, adding to the authentic and immersive experience.</p>

                <h2>Major Renovations Underway</h2>

                <p>While the 2026 season promises exciting productions, Rainbow Stage's Kildonan Park home is currently undergoing extensive renovations. Funded by civic, provincial, and federal governments, along with the Winnipeg Foundation, these improvements represent the first phase of a major construction project.</p>

                <p>By the time <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em> opens in June, guests will experience:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Refurbished external walkways leading to the venue</li>
                    <li>Renovated box office meeting modern accessibility standards</li>
                    <li>Updated bathroom facilities designed for accessibility</li>
                    <li>New doorways and raised exterior walls</li>
                </ul>

                <p>While the renovations will unfortunately diminish the theatre's 2009 exterior mural beyond repair, there are plans to add more color and visual interest to the concrete structure, ensuring Rainbow Stage remains a vibrant and welcoming destination.</p>

                <h2>A Winnipeg Treasure</h2>

                <p>Rainbow Stage is more than just a theatre—it's a Winnipeg institution that brings families together, creates lasting memories, and showcases incredible local talent. The outdoor setting in Kildonan Park creates a uniquely Manitoba experience that combines the best of summer weather, natural beauty, and world-class entertainment.</p>

                <p>As a professional not-for-profit arts organization, Rainbow Stage is deeply committed to fostering interest and appreciation in musical theatre while supporting the Manitoba arts community. The theatre employs more than half of the local arts workers, making it a tremendous economic driver for the city. They nurture Manitoba-based artists from their early professional years through retirement, creating a sustainable ecosystem for theatrical talent.</p>

                <p>Rainbow Stage also champions accessibility and inclusivity. A family of four can attend the theatre for about the same price as an afternoon at the movies, and over the past several years, the organization has provided over 10,000 tickets to deserving not-for-profit and community-focused organizations.</p>

                <p>Whether you're a longtime theatre enthusiast or experiencing your first musical, Rainbow Stage offers an unforgettable evening. There's something special about settling into your seat as the sun sets, feeling the warmth of a summer evening, and losing yourself in a story told through song and dance under the open sky.</p>

                <h2>Plan Your Visit</h2>

                <p>If you're visiting Winnipeg next summer, consider catching a show at <a href="https://www.rainbowstage.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Rainbow Stage</a>. <a href="https://www.rainbowstage.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Tickets</a> typically go on sale in the spring, and popular productions can sell out quickly—especially after the success of their recent seasons. Ticket prices start at $27 for children, making it an affordable family outing.</p>

                <h3>Practical Information for Your Visit</h3>

                <p>Here's what you need to know when planning your Rainbow Stage experience:</p>

                <p><strong>Location & Arrival:</strong> Rainbow Stage is located at 2021 Main Street in Kildonan Park. The theatre has on-site parking with attendants to help guide you, though parking is stacked to maximize capacity. If you prefer to avoid congestion, limited street parking is available on side streets within walking distance. Plan to arrive about 70 minutes before showtime—doors open one hour before the performance begins.</p>

                <p><strong>Weather-Proof Entertainment:</strong> One of Rainbow Stage's best features? The entire seating area is covered by the iconic dome! While it's an open-air theatre that lets you enjoy those beautiful summer evenings, the roof protects audiences from rain during performances, so shows are not cancelled due to weather.</p>

                <p><strong>Show Duration:</strong> Rainbow Stage productions typically run about 2.5 hours, including a 20-minute intermission. This gives you plenty of time to use the washroom facilities (located near the front entry doors), purchase concessions like popcorn and ice cream, or step outside to enjoy Kildonan Park during the break.</p>

                <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The theatre is fully accessible for patrons who use wheelchairs and other mobility devices. Entrances and washrooms are at ground level, and wheelchair-accessible seating is available in row 13. For accessible parking and seating arrangements, call the box office at <a href="tel:204-989-0888">204-989-0888</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Great Sightlines:</strong> There truly isn't a "bad" seat at Rainbow Stage! The seating is arranged so that everyone can see the entire stage, no matter how far back they're sitting. When buying tickets online, you can even preview the view from your selected seats before checkout.</p>

                <p><strong>Family-Friendly:</strong> Rainbow Stage welcomes guests of all ages! Every patron, regardless of age, requires a ticket, but child pricing makes it affordable to bring the whole family. Most productions are specifically designed for family audiences, though the box office can provide guidance on the suitability of specific shows.</p>

                <p><strong>Box Office:</strong> For ticket purchases or questions, contact the box office at <a href="tel:204-989-0888">204-989-0888</a> (toll-free: 1-888-989-0888) or email <a href="mailto:boxoffice@rainbowstage.ca">boxoffice@rainbowstage.ca</a>. During show runs, the box office at the park opens two hours before each performance.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Arrive early to explore Kildonan Park before the show! The park offers walking trails, gardens, and the famous Witch's Hut. Grab dinner at a nearby restaurant, enjoy the park, and then settle in for an unforgettable evening of theatre under the stars.</p>
                </div>

It's a testament to Winnipeg's vibrant arts scene and the city's commitment to outdoor entertainment that makes the most of our beautiful summer season.</p>
