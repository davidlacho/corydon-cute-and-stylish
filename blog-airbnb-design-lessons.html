            <div class="article-body">
                <p>After staying in Airbnbs across five continents over 14 years of hosting, we've learned what truly makes a space memorable. From a minimalist apartment in Tokyo to a bohemian loft in Barcelona, each stay taught us something valuable about design, comfort, and creating spaces that guests love.</p>

                <h2>The Power of Personal Touches</h2>
                <p>One of our most memorable stays was in a converted warehouse in Melbourne. What made it special wasn't the high-end finishes—it was the personal touches. The host had curated a collection of local art, vintage books about the neighborhood, and a handwritten guide to their favorite hidden spots.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Personal touches don't have to be expensive. They just need to be thoughtful. In our Winnipeg home, we've incorporated vintage finds, local artwork, and a comprehensive guidebook that shares our love for Corydon Village.</p>

                <h2>Functionality Over Form</h2>
                <p>We stayed in a stunning modern apartment in Copenhagen that looked like it belonged in a design magazine. But it was missing basic comforts—no hooks for coats, no place to put luggage, and the kitchen was beautiful but barely functional.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Beautiful design means nothing if guests can't comfortably use the space. Every design decision in our home considers how guests will actually live there. That's why we have dedicated workspaces, plenty of storage, and a fully equipped kitchen.</p>

                <h2>The Mid-Century Modern Appeal</h2>
                <p>Our stay in a mid-century modern home in Palm Springs was transformative. The clean lines, thoughtful use of space, and connection to nature created an atmosphere that was both stylish and relaxing. It felt like stepping into a different era while still being completely comfortable.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Mid-century design has timeless appeal. It's warm, inviting, and never goes out of style. This inspired our own mid-century modern aesthetic in Winnipeg, blending vintage charm with modern comfort.</p>

                <h2>Lighting Makes All the Difference</h2>
                <p>A tiny studio in Paris taught us the importance of lighting. Despite its small size, the space felt expansive because of thoughtful lighting—warm ambient lights, task lighting for reading, and natural light maximized through strategic mirror placement.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Good lighting can transform any space. We've ensured our home has multiple lighting options—bright for working, warm for relaxing, and natural light flooding through large windows.</p>

                <h2>Local Character Matters</h2>
                <p>In Lisbon, we stayed in a beautifully restored apartment that celebrated its neighborhood's history. The host had preserved original tiles, incorporated local crafts, and the space felt authentically Portuguese, not generic.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> The best Airbnbs feel like they belong to their location. Our Winnipeg home celebrates its Corydon neighborhood with local art, neighborhood history in our guidebook, and design choices that reflect the area's character.</p>

                <h2>Comfort is Non-Negotiable</h2>
                <p>We've stayed in places that looked incredible in photos but were uncomfortable to actually stay in—hard beds, poor mattresses, or spaces that prioritized aesthetics over livability.</p>
                <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> No amount of beautiful design can compensate for poor comfort. That's why we invest in quality mattresses, plush linens, and furniture that's both stylish and comfortable. Our guests consistently mention how well they sleep.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The best Airbnb designs balance aesthetics with functionality, personal touches with universal comfort, and local character with modern amenities. It's not about following trends—it's about creating spaces that feel like home while offering something unique.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What We've Applied to Our Winnipeg Home</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Curated vintage finds</strong> that tell a story and add character</li>
                    <li><strong>Thoughtful storage solutions</strong> so guests can truly unpack and feel at home</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple lighting options</strong> for different moods and activities</li>
                    <li><strong>Local touches</strong> that celebrate Corydon Village and Winnipeg</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality over quantity</strong> in every design choice</li>
                    <li><strong>Comfort-first approach</strong> to furniture and bedding selection</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Every stay teaches us something new, and we're constantly refining our space based on what we learn. The goal isn't perfection—it's creating a space where guests feel welcomed, comfortable, and inspired.</p>
