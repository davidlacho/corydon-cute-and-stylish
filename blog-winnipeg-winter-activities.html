                <p>Winnipeg is known for its cold winters, but rather than hiding indoors, Winnipeggers have learned to embrace and celebrate the winter season. The city transforms into a winter wonderland, offering unique activities and experiences that you can only enjoy when the temperature drops. From skating on frozen rivers to winter festivals, Winnipeg shows that winter can be a time of joy, activity, and community celebration.</p>

                <h2>Skating on the Rivers</h2>
                <p>One of Winnipeg's most magical winter experiences is skating on the frozen Red and Assiniboine Rivers. The Forks maintains skating trails on the river, creating a network of paths that wind along the frozen water. This is a truly unique experience—skating on a river with the city skyline as your backdrop.</p>

                <p>The skating trails are maintained and safe, with warming huts along the way where you can take breaks. The experience of gliding along a frozen river, surrounded by the winter landscape, is something you'll remember long after your visit.</p>

                <h2>Cross-Country Skiing</h2>
                <p>Winnipeg offers excellent cross-country skiing opportunities, with groomed trails in parks throughout the city. Assiniboine Park, Kildonan Park, and other green spaces maintain ski trails that are perfect for both beginners and experienced skiers.</p>

                <p>Cross-country skiing is a great way to stay active in winter while enjoying the beauty of Winnipeg's parks and natural areas. Many trails are free to use, making it an accessible winter activity.</p>

                <h2>Winter Festivals</h2>
                <p>Winnipeg doesn't let winter stop the celebration—instead, it creates festivals that embrace the season. Festival du Voyageur, held in February, is Western Canada's largest winter festival, featuring snow sculptures, music, food, and activities that celebrate French-Canadian culture.</p>

                <p>Other winter events include outdoor concerts, ice sculpture competitions, and community celebrations that bring people together despite the cold.</p>

                <h2>Outdoor Activities</h2>
                <p>Beyond skating and skiing, Winnipeg offers many other winter activities:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tobogganing</strong> - Many parks have designated hills for sledding</li>
                    <li><strong>Ice Fishing</strong> - Popular activity on frozen lakes and rivers (with proper safety precautions)</li>
                    <li><strong>Winter Walking</strong> - Many trails remain accessible for walking, offering peaceful winter landscapes</li>
                    <li><strong>Snowshoeing</strong> - Explore parks and natural areas on snowshoes</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Staying Warm</h2>
                <p>The key to enjoying Winnipeg's winter is dressing properly. Layers are essential, and you'll want:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Warm, waterproof boots</li>
                    <li>Insulated, waterproof outerwear</li>
                    <li>Warm hat, mittens, and scarf</li>
                    <li>Layers that can be adjusted as you warm up from activity</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Don't let the cold keep you indoors! With proper clothing, Winnipeg's winter activities are enjoyable and invigorating. Many activities are free or low-cost, making winter recreation accessible to everyone. Check conditions before heading out, especially for activities on frozen water, and always prioritize safety.</p>

                <h2>Why Winter Matters</h2>
                <p>Winnipeg's approach to winter—embracing it rather than enduring it—is part of what makes the city special. The winter activities create community, provide exercise, and offer unique experiences that you can only have in a cold climate.</p>

                <p>For visitors, experiencing Winnipeg in winter offers a chance to see how the city transforms, how communities come together, and how winter can be a time of celebration rather than just survival.</p>

                <p>Whether you're skating on the river, skiing through a park, or simply taking a winter walk, Winnipeg's winter activities show that the cold season can be beautiful, fun, and full of life.</p>
