            <div class="article-body">
                <p>Winnipeg underwent a massive transit transformation in June 2025 with the launch of its Primary Transit Network—the biggest overhaul in the city's 142-year transit history. Combined with the city's flat terrain, expanding cycling infrastructure, and winter-specific transportation quirks, navigating Winnipeg in 2026 requires understanding a few key systems. This guide cuts through the noise to tell you what actually works.</p>

                <h2>The New Transit Reality: Primary Transit Network (PTN)</h2>

                <h3>What Changed and Why It Matters</h3>
                <p>If you've visited Winnipeg before 2025, forget what you knew. The PTN replaced the old bus system with a spine-and-feeder model that actually makes sense. Primary routes now run every 5-15 minutes during peak hours with straighter, faster paths. Feeder routes connect neighborhoods to these main arteries, and when feeders aren't running, an On-Request shared-ride service operates in 12 zones across the city.</p>

                <p>The practical impact: you can now realistically use transit for major attractions without the old frustrations of 45-minute waits and circuitous routes. The system isn't perfect—this is still Winnipeg, not Tokyo—but it's genuinely improved.</p>

                <h3>Planning Your Transit Trips</h3>
                <p>Download the <strong>Transit app</strong> or use <strong>Navigo</strong> (Winnipeg's official trip planner). Both show real-time arrivals and work with the new PTN. The Transit app tends to be more intuitive for visitors, with clearer walking directions and integration with other modes like rideshare.</p>

                <p>For payment, get a <strong>Peggo card</strong> if you're staying more than a day or two. You can buy one at major transit stations, some convenience stores, or online. Cash fares work but are less convenient, and you'll need exact change. As of 2026, adult fares are typically around $3.30 per ride, with day passes and multi-ride options available on your Peggo card.</p>

                <h3>Zero-Emission Buses: A Real Thing Now</h3>
                <p>Winnipeg became the first Canadian city to deploy 60-foot articulated zero-emission buses in August 2025. Eight are now in service. You might not notice them beyond being quieter and having that new-bus smell, but they represent legitimate infrastructure modernization—these aren't just token environmental gestures.</p>

                <h2>From the Airport (YWG)</h2>
                <p>Winnipeg Richardson International Airport is about 7 km west of downtown. Your options:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uber/Lyft:</strong> $20-30 to downtown or Corydon, 15-25 minutes depending on traffic. Available at the rideshare pickup area on the lower level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Taxi:</strong> Similar price to rideshare, metered. Base fare starts around $3.50 plus $1.55 per 0.6 miles. Available at designated taxi stands.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transit:</strong> Routes connect to the airport, though with luggage and connections, this is most practical if you're budget-conscious and not in a rush. Check Navigo for current routes—airport service was expanded with the PTN.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rental Car:</strong> All major agencies (Enterprise, Budget, Hertz, Avis, National) operate at the airport. Expect around $40-60/day for a compact. Worth it if you're planning day trips beyond Winnipeg.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Rideshare & Taxis: When Transit Won't Cut It</h2>
                <p>Uber and Lyft both operate in Winnipeg with decent coverage, especially in core areas. Response times average 5-10 minutes in neighborhoods like Corydon, Osborne Village, and downtown. Traditional taxi companies also remain active and are sometimes faster late at night when rideshare drivers are sparse.</p>

                <p><strong>Winter consideration:</strong> When it's -30°C with windchill, waiting for a bus becomes dangerous. Keep a rideshare app ready and don't hesitate to use it. Frostbite can set in within 10-30 minutes in extreme cold, and Winnipeg winters hit those extremes regularly between December and February.</p>

                <h2>Driving & Parking: The Winnipeg Advantage</h2>
                <p>Unlike Toronto or Vancouver, Winnipeg is genuinely car-friendly. Traffic is manageable, parking is relatively cheap and available, and distances between attractions make having a car convenient for packing multiple destinations into a day.</p>

                <h3>When to Rent a Car</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You're planning trips to nearby provincial parks, Birds Hill, or lake country</li>
                    <li>You're visiting in winter and want climate-controlled travel</li>
                    <li>You're traveling with kids or lots of gear</li>
                    <li>You want to maximize sightseeing efficiency</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Parking Reality Check</h3>
                <p>Street parking in Corydon and Osborne Village uses meters and apps (PayByPhone is common). Most meters don't charge evenings after 5:30 PM or on Sundays. Downtown parking lots charge $5-12 for a full day. Major attractions like The Forks and Assiniboine Park have dedicated lots—The Forks charges but Assiniboine Park is usually free.</p>

                <p><strong>Winter parking bans:</strong> When snow clearing is declared (common January-March), street parking restrictions activate. Check for signage or the city's website. Your car will get towed if you're parked on a snow route during a ban.</p>

                <h2>Walking & Cycling: Summer vs. Winter</h2>

                <h3>Summer (May-September)</h3>
                <p>Winnipeg is flat and increasingly bike-friendly. Protected bike lanes exist on major corridors, though the network is still patchy compared to cities like Montreal. The riverbank trails (along the Red and Assiniboine) are excellent for cycling and connect many attractions.</p>

                <p>Neighborhoods like Corydon, The Exchange District, Osborne Village, and the area around The Forks are genuinely walkable with good density of restaurants, shops, and cafes. You can easily spend a full day exploring these areas on foot.</p>

                <p><strong>Bike rentals:</strong> Several shops rent bikes for $30-50/day. No major bike-share system exists as of 2026, so you'll need to go through traditional rental shops.</p>

                <h3>Winter (November-March)</h3>
                <p>This is where Winnipeg gets real. The <strong>Winnipeg Walkway System</strong> (the "Skywalk") is a network of heated indoor skywalks and tunnels connecting downtown buildings. It's not glamorous, but when it's -35°C outside, it's genius. You can walk from hotels to restaurants, shops, and offices without ever going outside. The system isn't comprehensively mapped online—you often just follow signs once you're inside a connected building.</p>

                <p>For outdoor walking: dress in layers, cover all skin, invest in serious winter boots, and accept that walking distances shrink dramatically. That pleasant 15-minute summer stroll becomes a teeth-chattering ordeal in January. Plan shorter outdoor legs and use transit or rideshare to bridge longer distances.</p>

                <p>Cycling in winter: Some hardy locals do it with fat-tire bikes, but it's not practical for visitors. Skip it unless you're specifically here for winter biking adventure.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>The Corydon Advantage:</strong> If you're staying in the Corydon neighborhood, you're in one of Winnipeg's most walkable areas. Within 10 minutes on foot: 50+ restaurants, multiple coffee shops, bars, boutiques, and grocery stores. Osborne Village is a 15-minute walk south. Major attractions like Assiniboine Park are a short transit ride or 10-minute drive. The neighborhood genuinely works without a car in summer; in winter, you'll still want transit or rideshare for anything beyond immediate needs.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Getting to Major Attractions</h2>

                <h3>The Forks</h3>
                <p>Downtown, easily walkable from most hotels. Multiple transit routes connect here. Parking lot available ($). This is Winnipeg's tourist hub—market, restaurants, skating in winter, river walks in summer.</p>

                <h3>Assiniboine Park & Zoo</h3>
                <p>Western edge of the city. Transit-accessible via PTN routes, about 30-40 minutes from downtown. Easier by car (15 minutes from Corydon). The park is massive—allocate 2-4 hours. Free admission to the park; zoo charges admission.</p>

                <h3>Canadian Museum for Human Rights</h3>
                <p>At The Forks. Same access as above. Worth booking tickets online in advance.</p>

                <h3>Exchange District</h3>
                <p>Downtown's historic warehouse district. Walkable, transit-friendly, street parking available. Best for galleries, cafes, and architecture.</p>

                <h2>Late-Night Transportation: The Weak Link</h2>
                <p>Winnipeg's transit historically ended too early, and while expansion is planned for 2026's budget, as of now, late-night options are limited. After bars close (2 AM), you're looking at taxis or rideshare. Keep this in mind for nights out—prices surge when transit stops running and bar crowds hit the streets simultaneously.</p>

                <h2>Arriving by Train or Intercity Bus</h2>
                <p><strong>VIA Rail</strong> stops at Union Station (123 Main Street) downtown. The station is historic and central. From here, you're walking distance to The Forks or a short taxi ride to most hotels.</p>

                <p><strong>Intercity buses</strong> typically arrive downtown as well, with connections to Brandon, Thompson, and other Manitoba cities.</p>

                <h2>What Actually Works: A Visitor's Summary</h2>

                <p><strong>Best for day-tripping and winter flexibility:</strong> Rent a car</p>
                <p><strong>Best for downtown/Forks/Exchange District:</strong> Walk + transit + occasional rideshare</p>
                <p><strong>Best for Corydon area stays:</strong> Walk for neighborhood dining/shopping, transit for attractions, rideshare for late nights</p>
                <p><strong>Best for summer active travel:</strong> Rent a bike, use riverbank trails</p>
                <p><strong>Best for brutal winter days:</strong> Rideshare and the Skywalk system</p>

                <p>Winnipeg isn't a transit-first city like Toronto, but the 2025 PTN upgrade made public transportation legitimately useful for visitors. Combined with the city's affordable parking and good rideshare coverage, you have real options. Plan according to season, your home base, and your cold tolerance—those three factors will determine your ideal transportation mix more than any universal recommendation.</p>
