                <p>After 14 years of hosting and staying in Airbnbs across five continents, we've seen what separates good hosts from great ones. Here are the practices that have consistently impressed us and that we've incorporated into our own hosting approach.</p>

                <h2>Communication is Everything</h2>
                <p>The best hosts we've encountered were always responsive, clear, and helpful. They sent detailed check-in instructions before arrival, checked in after guests settled, and were available without being intrusive.</p>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> We send a comprehensive guidebook before arrival, provide clear self-check-in instructions, and are always available via message. We also follow up after check-in to ensure everything is perfect.</p>

                <h2>The Welcome Matters</h2>
                <p>In Tokyo, our host left a handwritten note, local snacks, and a map with their favorite spots marked. It immediately made us feel welcomed and set the tone for our entire stay.</p>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> Every guest receives a personalized welcome message, our detailed guidebook, and we're always happy to share our favorite local spots. Small touches make a big difference.</p>

                <h2>Think Like a Guest</h2>
                <p>We stayed in a beautiful apartment in Barcelona that was missing basic things—no extra toilet paper, no trash bags, no instructions for appliances. The host clearly hadn't thought through what guests actually need.</p>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> We stock essentials generously, provide clear instructions for everything, and think through every detail from where to put luggage to how to work the coffee maker.</p>

                <h2>Local Knowledge is Invaluable</h2>
                <p>Our favorite hosts were those who shared genuine local insights—not just tourist recommendations, but where they actually go. A host in Lisbon took time to explain the neighborhood's history and culture, making our stay so much richer.</p>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> Our guidebook is packed with local favorites—cafes we actually visit, hidden gems in Corydon, and insider tips that only locals know. We're always happy to share more via message.</p>

                <h2>Quality Over Quantity</h2>
                <p>We've stayed in places with every amenity imaginable but poor quality—cheap towels, uncomfortable beds, or appliances that barely work. Conversely, a simple apartment in Copenhagen had high-quality basics that made all the difference.</p>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> We invest in quality where it matters—comfortable beds, plush linens, reliable appliances, and thoughtful amenities. Better to have fewer, high-quality items than a long list of cheap ones.</p>

                <h2>Respect Guest Privacy</h2>
                <p>The best hosts strike a balance between being available and giving guests space. They're helpful when needed but never intrusive.</p>
                <p><strong>What we do:</strong> We use self-check-in, provide all information guests need upfront, and are available via message without being present. Guests can enjoy their privacy while knowing we're here if needed.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The best hosting practices come from genuinely caring about guest experience. When you think like a guest and anticipate their needs, everything else falls into place.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What Makes Our Approach Different</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive guidebooks</strong> with real local insights, not just tourist recommendations</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast, friendly communication</strong> that's helpful without being overwhelming</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality amenities</strong> that guests actually want to use</li>
                    <li><strong>Thoughtful touches</strong> that show we care about the details</li>
                    <li><strong>Local expertise</strong> that helps guests experience Winnipeg like locals</li>
                    <li><strong>Respect for privacy</strong> while being available when needed</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Hosting isn't just about providing a place to stay—it's about creating an experience. Every interaction, every detail, and every touchpoint matters. After 14 years and countless stays as guests ourselves, we've learned that the best hosts are those who genuinely care about their guests' experience.</p>
