            <div class="article-body">
                <p>Since 2011, I've stayed in over 80 Airbnbs across five continents—from a tiny studio in Paris to a villa in Canggu, from a converted warehouse in Berlin to a mid-century modern home in Palm Springs. Each stay, whether exceptional or frustrating, has taught me something about what guests actually need and want.</p>

                <p>This isn't just travel for pleasure—it's research. Every check-in, every interaction, every moment of confusion or delight has shaped how I approach hosting. Here's how my experiences as a guest inform every decision I make as a host.</p>

                <h2>The Power of Multiple Perspectives</h2>
                <p>When you've been both the guest and the host, you see things differently. I've arrived exhausted after a 12-hour flight to find no clear check-in instructions. I've also arrived to handwritten notes, local snacks, and a host who genuinely cared about my experience.</p>

                <p>I've stayed in places that looked perfect in photos but were missing basic essentials—no extra toilet paper, no trash bags, no instructions for the quirky European washing machine. I've also stayed in places where hosts thought through every detail, anticipating needs I didn't even know I had.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>The Key Insight:</strong> The best hosts don't just provide a place to stay—they think like guests. They anticipate needs, solve problems before they arise, and create experiences that feel effortless.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Learning from the Great Experiences</h2>
                <p>Some stays have been transformative. In Tokyo, our host left a handwritten note, local snacks, and a map with their favourite spots marked. In Lisbon, a host took time to explain the neighbourhood's history, making our stay richer and more meaningful. In Canggu, our host invited us for home-cooked dinners, creating a connection that lasted long after our stay.</p>

                <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Small touches matter. Personal notes, local recommendations, and genuine care create memorable experiences. These hosts didn't just provide accommodation—they created connections.</p>

                <p>In Budapest, a host provided detailed instructions for everything—how to use the washing machine, where to find the best local markets, even how to navigate the complex public transit system. In Berlin, a host left a comprehensive guidebook with restaurant recommendations, cultural insights, and neighbourhood history.</p>

                <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Information is a gift. When guests arrive in a new city, they're often overwhelmed. Clear instructions, helpful guides, and local knowledge reduce stress and enhance the experience.</p>

                <h2>Learning from the Frustrating Experiences</h2>
                <p>Not every stay has been perfect, and those experiences have been just as valuable. In Marseille, we arrived to find the apartment didn't match the photos, with broken appliances and missing amenities. The host was unresponsive, leaving us feeling stranded in a foreign city.</p>

                <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Communication is everything. When things go wrong, hosts need to be available and responsive. Silence creates anxiety and frustration. I always respond to messages quickly, even if it's just to acknowledge a concern and let guests know I'm working on it.</p>

                <p>In Barcelona, we stayed in a beautiful apartment that was missing basic essentials—no extra toilet paper, no trash bags, no dish soap. The host clearly hadn't thought through what guests actually need day-to-day.</p>

                <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Anticipate needs. I stock essentials generously—toilet paper, trash bags, cleaning supplies, basic toiletries. I think through what guests will need from the moment they arrive to the moment they leave.</p>

                <p>In Copenhagen, we stayed in a stunning modern apartment that prioritized aesthetics over functionality. There were no hooks for coats, no place to put luggage, and the kitchen was beautiful but barely usable.</p>

                <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Functionality matters more than perfection. Every design decision in our Winnipeg home considers how guests will actually live there. That's why we have dedicated workspaces, plenty of storage, and a fully equipped kitchen.</p>

                <h2>Anticipating Guest Needs</h2>
                <p>After 14 years of travel, I've learned to think like a guest. When someone arrives after a long flight, what do they need? Clear check-in instructions, a comfortable place to rest, and information about the neighbourhood.</p>

                <p>When someone is staying for a week or more, what do they need? A fully equipped kitchen, laundry facilities, and space to truly unpack and feel at home. When someone is visiting in winter, what do they need? Information about parking, heating, and how to navigate snowy streets.</p>

                <p><strong>What I do:</strong> I send a comprehensive guidebook before arrival, provide clear self-check-in instructions, and am always available via message. I think through every scenario—late arrivals, early departures, special requests, unexpected problems.</p>

                <h2>The Details That Make a Difference</h2>
                <p>It's often the small things that separate good hosts from great ones. In Tokyo, our host left slippers by the door—a small touch that made us feel welcomed. In Lisbon, our host provided a local SIM card recommendation, saving us from expensive roaming charges.</p>

                <p>In Berlin, our host left a bottle of local beer in the fridge. In Puerto Vallarta, our host provided beach towels and a cooler for day trips. In Montreal, our host left a list of the best bagel shops in the neighbourhood.</p>

                <p><strong>What I do:</strong> I think about the details that make a stay easier and more enjoyable. I provide local recommendations that go beyond tourist guides. I share neighbourhood history and culture. I'm always thinking about what would make a guest's experience better.</p>

                <h2>Communication: The Foundation of Great Hosting</h2>
                <p>I've stayed in places where hosts were responsive and helpful, and places where hosts were difficult to reach or unhelpful. The difference is night and day.</p>

                <p>Great hosts communicate clearly and proactively. They send check-in instructions before arrival, check in after guests settle, and are available without being intrusive. They respond quickly to questions and concerns, and they're genuinely helpful.</p>

                <p><strong>What I do:</strong> I send detailed information before arrival, check in after guests settle, and am always available via message. I respond quickly, usually within minutes during waking hours. I'm proactive about potential issues—if there's construction nearby, I let guests know. If there's a weather event, I provide helpful information.</p>

                <h2>Creating Memorable Experiences</h2>
                <p>The best stays aren't just about the accommodation—they're about the experience. In Canggu, our host's hospitality created a lifelong friendship. In Tokyo, our host's local recommendations led us to experiences we never would have found on our own.</p>

                <p>In Lisbon, our host's passion for the neighbourhood made us fall in love with the city. In Budapest, our host's detailed guidebook helped us experience the city like locals, not tourists.</p>

                <p><strong>What I do:</strong> I create experiences, not just accommodations. My guidebook is packed with local favourites—cafes I actually visit, hidden gems in Corydon, and insider tips that only locals know. I share neighbourhood history and culture. I'm always happy to provide more recommendations via message.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>My Promise:</strong> Every decision I make as a host is informed by my experiences as a guest. I think about what would make a stay easier, more comfortable, and more memorable. I anticipate needs, solve problems proactively, and create experiences that guests will remember long after they leave.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>What This Means for Our Guests</h2>
                <p>When you stay with us, you're benefiting from 14 years of travel experience. Every detail—from the comprehensive guidebook to the stocked essentials, from the clear check-in instructions to the local recommendations—is informed by what I've learned as a guest.</p>

                <p>I know what it's like to arrive exhausted after a long journey, so I make check-in as smooth as possible. I know what it's like to feel lost in a new city, so I provide detailed local guides. I know what it's like to encounter unexpected problems, so I'm always available and responsive.</p>

                <p>I've experienced both exceptional and frustrating stays, and I'm committed to creating the former. Every interaction, every detail, and every touchpoint is designed to make your stay as comfortable, enjoyable, and memorable as possible.</p>

                <h2>The Journey Continues</h2>
                <p>I'm still traveling, still learning, still experiencing new places and new hosts. Every stay teaches me something new, and I'm constantly refining our approach based on what I learn.</p>

                <p>The goal isn't perfection—it's continuous improvement. It's about genuinely caring about guest experience and being willing to evolve based on feedback and new insights. It's about creating spaces and experiences that guests will remember and want to return to.</p>

                <p>After 14 years and 80+ stays, I've learned that great hosting comes from understanding the guest perspective. It comes from anticipating needs, solving problems proactively, and creating experiences that feel effortless. It comes from genuinely caring about the people who choose to stay with you.</p>
