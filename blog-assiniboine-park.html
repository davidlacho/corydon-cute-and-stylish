                <p>Spanning over 400 acres in the heart of Winnipeg, <a href="https://www.assiniboinepark.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assiniboine Park</a> is one of the city's most beloved green spaces. Whether you're looking for family fun, peaceful walks, world-class gardens, or a visit to the zoo, this park offers something for everyone. And with the recent addition of <a href="https://www.assiniboinepark.ca/leaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Leaf</a>—a stunning new conservatory—Assiniboine Park has become an even more essential Winnipeg destination.</p>

                <h2>A Park for All Seasons</h2>
                <p>Assiniboine Park has been a Winnipeg treasure since it opened in 1909. Designed by landscape architect Frederick G. Todd, the park was created to provide residents with a beautiful natural space for recreation and relaxation. Over a century later, it continues to serve that purpose while evolving to meet modern needs.</p>

                <p>The park is open year-round, transforming with each season. Spring brings cherry blossoms and tulips, summer offers lush greenery and outdoor activities, fall showcases brilliant colors, and winter provides opportunities for skating, cross-country skiing, and enjoying the snow-covered landscape.</p>

                <h2>The Leaf: A Modern Conservatory</h2>
                <p>One of Winnipeg's newest and most impressive attractions, The Leaf is a state-of-the-art conservatory that opened in 2022. This architectural marvel houses four distinct biomes, each representing different climates and ecosystems from around the world.</p>

                <h3>The Biomes</h3>
